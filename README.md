## Featured Work (WIP — building in public)
> I’m actively adding more engineering-focused repositories to showcase my SDE skills.

- ✅ **Automation & Reliability Tools (Python)** — scripts/utilities that reduce toil and improve operational workflows
- ✅ **Spring Boot API Projects** — REST services with clean structure, validation, tests, and docs
- ✅ **Kubernetes/DevOps Examples** — manifests, deployment patterns, and CI/CD learning projects

📌 **Pinned repos** will reflect the best examples as I publish them.
